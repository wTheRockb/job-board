In the winter we do snow removal so we are less busy from mid December through early April and only work during snowfalls. Guys in positions 2/3 usually make enough money in the spring/summer/fall to pay their bills over the winter and don't take outside work during the winter. I try to treat both our employees and customers fairly and honestly. Preferably you would have commercial lawn mowing experience. You MUST at least have experience cutting a personal lawn and be highly competent with a string trimmer. A driver's license is MANDATORY. We have 4 positions at this company. You would be hired in at the lowest position but if you prove your skills/reliability we would advance your pay and responsibilities quickly.\n\nSpot 1- Crew passenger- You would primarily be responsible for running hand tools (String trimmer, stick edger, blower) until you have mastered the hand tools. After you master the hand tools we would begin to train you on the mower with the goal of having you cut several lawns a day on the mower until you are as capable as the crew leader. Pay $17 TO $20\n\nSpot 2-Crew Leader- You would be primarily responsible for navigating to each job, holding a company gas card, and executing all aspects of cutting lawns to make them look good. Pay: Commission based on production usually $25-$30+ per hour depending on how good/fast/efficient your crew works.\n\nSpot 3- Authorized Subcontractor- You would be responsible for owning, maintaining, and storing your own equipment. Hiring your own help and maintaining your own insurances. We would provide a route for you to complete each week. You would service the route and bill us for your cut of what the customer will be billed. We would bill the customers and service the accounts. Pay: We have owner/operators running 2 trucks(2 men per truck) and making 7K most weeks and we have single owner/operators with no help making $2500 most weeks. It all depends on how efficiently you manage the work we give you but we would give you very dense routes and profitable work.\n\nSpot 4- Office staff- We handle client services, accounting, collections, marketing, job assignments, staffing, and everything to make the guys who cut lawns jobs as easy/straightforward as possible.\n\nPromotions here are based on proof of skills/reliability/trustworthiness through time. I am looking for someone who wants long term career perspectives. I need good/long-term help and am willing to pay if you help me handle business.

We would not hire you if you insist on continuing to service the accounts you currently have. Instead, we would compensate you to turn over any lawn accounts you have in our service area to our management. You would cancel service with any customers outside of our service area and we would provide you with a more bountiful and dense route for you to work.\n\nRain Days: If we have a rain delay we will compensate you with your hourly rate if we ask you to wait for the rain to stop.\n\nHealthcare: After 60 days on the job we offer a Health insurance rebate.

Pay can increase from there as your responsibilities increase.\n\nYou will fit in well with the rest of the team here if these qualities describe you: Integrity, strong values, likes to step up to a challenge, able to lead, likes to organize, has an eye for detail, loves efficiency, and a deep desire to do things right.\n\nOpen positions are full-time during the green season, often 10 hour days with occasional overtime on Fridays. 3 day weekends are not uncommon in the summer.  We do not work weekends during the green season. Because winter is our focus we offer more hours and more opportunities for overtime during the winter compared to average.\n\nYou can earn here full benefits including Health Insurance, Retirement Plan, Vacation, Paid Holidays, and Training for personal and professional development.\n\nYou can appreciate as a growing company that the rest of the team here is creating new positions on a consistent basis, and it is our goal to promote from within.  A job with Sneller Snow & Grounds provides many opportunities for personal and professional development. If you apply to join this team that employs hundreds of people during the winter, then we can share our specific growth plans and track record with you.  You can then find out how that can translate into developing opportunities and greater fulfillment for you.\n\nMembers of our team say they enjoy working here because the corporate culture is so positive.  We provide a high-quality service, so our customers really appreciate us. The work is fast paced and stimulating.  Our team members go on to say that the company values make this an enjoyable environment for which you can be thankful and proud to be a part of.  \n\nYou can find out more about what it is like here by viewing the videos on our website, and also feel free to check out our culture for yourself on our Facebook Page.

It\u2019s a duty. That\u2019s just how you roll. \n\u2022\tEXCELLENCE: You always keep a clean truck, clean tools and a clean shirt. Because that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. \n\u2022\tHEART: You genuinely like people.  \n\nI don\u2019t hire people if all they have is skill; I hire the people who have the highest work ethic and most eagerness to become exceptional at what they do. And then I make sure they get the training they need, make the money they deserve and then insure they have enough time for their FAMILY. Because a burned out employee with an unhappy home life doesn\u2019t work. \n\nOur goal is to be the BEST, not the cheapest. And that\u2019s why I happily admit: \n\nI put my employees FIRST. Customers come second.\n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s only happy employees that can make happy customers! \n\nIt\u2019s that simple. And that truth has led us to the pride we take in having the best team, the most knowledgeable people, basically the happiest landscape company around! Happy to work smarter and harder and make more money than all the rest. \n\nDo you like to work smarter AND harder?\nDo you want to make more money and enjoy more freedom? \n\nGreat! Then here\u2019s how you\u2019ll start:\n\n\u2022\tGuaranteed 40 hr work week \n\u2022\tYour own truck and phone\n\u2022\t$13 - $16 hr to start (increasing with training and experience!)  \n\u2022\tPlus Up to $8,000.00 in available Bonuses and Commissions. \n \nI realize that someone like you already has a job, but, this job is way better! Because I understand your problem: \n\n\u2022\tYou are overworked. \n\u2022\tYou are underappreciated. \n\u2022\tYou don\u2019t make the money you deserve. \n\u2022\tYou don\u2019t have steady enough work, year-round.\n\u2022\tYou\u2019re not being given the opportunity to ADVANCE.  \n\nBut I strive to deliver what great working employees need: \n\n\u2022\tFreedom to spend extra time on your work, enough time to make sure it all looks and works perfectly. We do it right. We know you don\u2019t drag your feet on a job. And we try hard to make sure you\u2019re home with your family in time for dinner!\n\n\u2022\tSteady work all year long. You don\u2019t want to have to worry about being \u201clet go\u201d in the slower times of the year. But we work all four seasons. I believe in full-time work, and career opportunities for my Team, not seasonal work. \n\n\u2022\tEnough time off with your family. Because an overworked, burned out tech is not the goal. We put our employees first, customers second; Because we know that it\u2019s happy employees that MAKE happy customers! \n\n\u2022\tBetter pay, more opportunity. I believe in paying you more than average salary to start, and let you rise to the occasion and BE that level of employee. And then give you a path to rise as high as your skill and desire drives you to go. \n\nJOINING THE TEAM: \nMost of the people who work here have been here for several years. This is not a place with a lot of turnover. That should tell you something. This is a truly amazing job for the right person. No one here ever says, \u201cthat\u2019s not my job.\u201d We work together. We help each other, and we all succeed. \n\nREQUIREMENTS: \n\u2022\tEnthusiastic\n\u2022\tA multi-tasker \n\u2022\tEngaging and energetic\n\u2022\tOutgoing \n\u2022\tProactive; You look for the things that need to be done. \n\u2022\tTrustworthy \u2013 don\u2019t need micromanaging\n\u2022\tWork well with a Team \n\u2022\tWork well alone\n\u2022\tA great sense of humor (the humorless will be fired!) \n\u2022\tGenuine heart for people\n\nOh, and of course, no addicts, abusers or excuse-makers. Basically, no riff-raff. But that\u2019s not you, right?\n\nEDUCATION: \nYou don\u2019t need to be able to do calculus and speak French. \nBut morons, whiners, idiots, lazy people and drama queens need not apply. \n\nATTITUDE:\nLike we said, you can\u2019t teach the right attitude. You\u2019ve either got it, or you don\u2019t.\n\n\nJOINING THE TEAM: \nMost of the people who work here have been here for several years. This is not a place with a lot of turnover. That should tell you something. This is a truly amazing job for the right person.\n\nSpeaking of which, we greatly value thoroughness and the ability to focus, so we\u2019re putting a special word in this paragraph to weed out sloppy people, half-hearted people, inattentive people and people without a sense of humor. Anyone skimming through job descriptions and blindly blasting out resumes won\u2019t see this line. But you\u2019re actually reading this job description, aren\u2019t you? Nicely done. Put the word, \u201c#HAPPYHERO\u201d in the subject line of your reply, and I\u2019ll give your resume the same respect you\u2019ve given this job description. I\u2019ll actually read it! Any application that does not have #HAPPYHERO in the subject line, will be printed out, wadded into a ball, and tossed into the trash via sky hook, nothing but net.\n\nIf you have the personality and natural abilities I\u2019ve described AND pass all those requirements? -reply via email and give me your story. \n\nI\u2019m serious. I\u2019d like to hear a story, maybe of how you\u2019ve gone above and beyond for a customer in the past, maybe about how you handle working with teams of people. Maybe a story about what this job might mean to you and your family. Maybe a story about your dreams, what your goals are. \nResumes don\u2019t tell me jack. Stories tell me who you are.\n\nOnce I get it I\u2019ll read it over, and contact you if I\u2019m ready to talk. \nIf you haven\u2019t heard back in a week, you didn\u2019t get the job. Sorry about that.\n \nBut if you\u2019re the right fit, this really is a place you can shine. \nIf you commit to us, we\u2019ll have your back, always.\n\nAn amazing new opportunity might be just an email away! \n\nWe look forward to meeting you.\n\n\nKenny Grebe \nRedShovel.com\n    ", "lattitude": "35.183349", "longitude": "-106.615341", "location_name": "Albuquerque", "region_name": "albuquerque", "url": "https://albuquerque.craigslist.org/trd/d/albuquerque-wanted-an-expert-at-serving/7297331757.html"},

I would like to have somebody that is easy to work with, has an extensive portfolio of houses that he/she has completed with permission to inspect his/her work.\nThis person shall have the where-with-all to perform the work in a timely manner, and excellent craftsmanship in all areas of building.  The ability to get large crew, sub contractors on a moments notice to get the job done.  \nBlueprints will be provided for two of the properties, another has just the floor plan and structural, as well as some elevation shots.  This plan will need to be sent through  HVAC,  PLUMBING & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS, OR AN ONSITE MEP COULD BE USED.  \nThis requirement for engineered drawings is a must, not because of code, but because of the complexity of the home itself.  This home is close to 6,500 sq ft, inside the home will feature an \"Indoor Tropical Room\" complete with an indoor swimming pool, waterfalls, a grotto, hot tub, etc.  The room itself shall be aprox. 1400 square feet and encompass all three floors.   \nI do have a sub contractor that will do this work if you are uncomfortable with it.  \nThis is what I believe to be the most important qualities of the job:\n#1.  The ability to communicate to myself as the owner, the subcontractors as to exactly what you want.\n#2.  The contacts to get the work done in a timely and organized manner, In-Other-Words, the ability to get the people that you need to get the job done.   \n#3.  The skill and the craftsmanship to not only get the job done, but get the job done with excellent craftsmanship.  \n#4.  This job is located in the Big Lake area, and in fact all three houses are within a block of each other.  If you require an out of state contractor, I can offer housing.  However, for the core crew, they will need to either obtain their own housing or commute.\n#5.  My architect will be on site some days and filming certain areas, just like a code compliance inspector would where there are codes that are enforced.  I will require that all work meet the codes that are in place in Anchorage, Alaska.  In fact I have built before and have seen where a 24\" on center wall framing was adequate, I ALWAYS build 16\" OC, and usually go above and beyond.  On these homes, the walls will be 2 X 8's because I like both exterior and interior (2 X 6\"'s) to have not only fiberglass insulation but also four inches of blown in rigid insulation exterior, and 2 inches interior (for noise abatement).  \n#6.  There will be extensive landscaping on these homes, including the planting of trees and shrubbery, along with installing a well system and a septic system for each home.  \n#7. Record keeping is a must, I would like copies of bond, insurance and a copy of your license, as well as see some of your previous work.\n#8.  I am a wholesaler of building materials, so a lot of the building materials will be supplied by myself.  I understand that some of a General Contractors profit comes from up charging or building materials, so your bids may reflect that.  \nAnd as I said at the beginning,  the best quality a general can have with me is to be honest, sincere and be able to bring up challenges and problems early on and we work them out.
